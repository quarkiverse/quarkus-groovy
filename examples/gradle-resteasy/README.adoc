= Gradle Resteasy Example

== Introduction

This example is meant to show how the Quarkus Groovy extension can be used with Gradle as build tool.

== Packaging and running the example

The example can be packaged using:

[source,sh]
----
$ ./gradlew build
----

It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `build/quarkus-app/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar build/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

== Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using:

[source,sh]
----
$ ./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=native
----

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using:

[source,sh]
----
$ ./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=native -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
----

You can then execute your native executable with: `./build/gradle-resteasy-${project.version}-runner`
